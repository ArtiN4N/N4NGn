    - basically everything in g4n
    - basically everything in ecs
- error handling
    - negative values when dealing with maps (physics done in floats)
    - nil values for pointers
- tests
    - cap_negative_line_coords
    
    - finish physics util
    - all valid ecs
    - texture set loading
    - tile loading
- texture set loading
    - rewrite large portion, perhaps even foundation
    - get an accurate proc to read wether a texture handle is currently loaded
- Design an efficient asset loading/unloading structure
- Procedural animation  
- Efficient Background drawing
    - for example, if using a tile map, and there are 1000 tiles for the current loaded area, instead of drawing all 1000 tiles (or what can fit in the screen) every frame,
    instead create a texture in sdl of all 1000 tiles, and draw the big map texture offset by position
- ecs
